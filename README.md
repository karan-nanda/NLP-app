### NLP Based Web App - Summarizer, Sentiment Analysis, NER, Text Completion, and Question Answering


## Project Overview - 

This Natural Language Processing (NLP) based web app utilizes Hugging Face transformers for advanced text summarization, sentiment analysis, text completion, and question answering. For Named Entity Recognition (NER), the app employs spacy-transformers. The web app serves as a comprehensive NLP solution, incorporating advanced transformers. It is designed to facilitate various text-based tasks in everyday life.

## Features - 

The NLP web app offers the following features:

**Text Summarization**: Utilizes Hugging Face transformers to generate concise summaries of input text.

**Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of given text using advanced NLP techniques.

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Employs spacy-transformers to identify and extract named entities (such as people, organizations, locations) from text.

**Text Completion**: Utilizes Hugging Face transformers to suggest completion options for partially entered text.

**Question Answering**: Employs Hugging Face transformers to provide answers to questions based on a given context.
